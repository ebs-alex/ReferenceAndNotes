Command Line Interface ("Terminal", "Shell") Notes

pwd -> Present Working Directory

cd -> move to home directory

cd .. -> move one directory ABOVE

cd ../.. -> move 2 directories above

cd ../x -> move 1 directory above then into directory x 

cd - -> move to previous directory present

~ -> shorthand for "home directory" when typing out absolute filepath

mv x y -> move target x to location y. Also used for renaming. 

cp x y -> copy target x to location y

rm x -> remove target x. Does not work on directories

rm -r dir  -> remove directory dir. Muss use the -r option

rm -i x -> remove target x but with a prompt before removal executed. 

* = wildcard matches zero or more characters in a filename, so *.txt matches all files ending in .txt. 

? = matches any single character in a filename, so ?.txt matches a.txt but not any.txt. Can be chained together.   

cat = reads out simple text file onto CLI "cat example.txt"

touch x = create a blank txt file named "x"

sort = sort alphabetically

sort -n = sort numerically, smallest to largest

sort -nr = sort numerically, largest to smallest

sort x > y = the sorted output of file x will be put into new created file y

> x = output into new file x or overwrite completely existing file x

>> = sends output result and appends to end of existing file x, or creates new file x.  


x | y | z = run x, then with output x run y, then with output of y run z
